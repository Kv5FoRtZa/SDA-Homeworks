    Descrition

  In this homework i was required to create a binary tree and perform a couple operations on said tree. As input, i got a couple nodes with a value and a string attached to them, and i was tasked with making unions betwen said nodes. The given nodes were supposed to remain terminal nodes, and in order to complete the tree, i had to create new nodes that had as value the sum of their direct children valuess, and as string the two child strings concatenated. 
  
  The tasks required me to create the structure, iterate through it from the root to a terminal node and then the opposite, find the lowest common ancestor between 2 given nodes and insert another couple trees in the same way in order to find the distance between 2 nodes in the new
bigger tree
